One problem with monad encodings is the run-time complexity might be greater.

For a string s of length n, calculate the asymptotic complexity of
  (a) are_balanced_mutable s
  (b) are_balanced_monadic s
respectively. Show your work so you can get partial credit.

Write your answer below.

(a) The asymptotic complexity of the mutable stack solution is O(n). Each push/pop
operation on the stack is constant time, assuming a linked list or resizable list-based
solution. Because the perform at most n push/pop operations, the overall time
complexity is O(n).

(b) The asymptotic complexity of the monadic stack solution is also O(n). Even with 
an immutable stack, push/pop only takes O(1) time. Albeit, we do incur the additional 
overhead of threading references to this stack between function calls, and the memory 
accesses could potentially thrash the cache because each node is not necessarily allocated
in a contiguous memory block. Despite this, asymptotically, because we still only 
perform at most n push/pop operations, the overall time complexity is O(n).
