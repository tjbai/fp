## Assignment 5

For this assignment we will refactor some stateful OCaml code to use a state monad.

- Answer the code and written questions in [this zip file](assignment5.zip) for your assignment.
- Like assignment 1-4, we are giving you a skeleton to fill in. Your answers will go in the file `assignment5/src/monads.ml` with a discussion question in `assignment5/src/discussion.txt`. You may modify `assignment5/src/monads.mli` to expose your extra credit solution.
- Note that we provide a template for tests, but we are not going to grade your tests or coverage as the code here is simple, and it is primarily a conceptual assignment.

### Submission and Grading

- As usual, run a final `dune clean; dune build` and then upload `_build/default/assignment5.zip` to Gradescope.
