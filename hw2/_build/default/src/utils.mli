Put all helper functions needed for keywordcount here. This should contain no functions
that help only your implementation of simpledict. Helper functions should be tested, and
they go in this library so that they are testable. If they are only in keywordcount.ml,
which compiles to an executable, then they are not accessible from a test file.

Feel free to remove `placeholder` when you add your actual functions.
